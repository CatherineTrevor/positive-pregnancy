# Project Overview

A site dedicated to selling pregnancy fitness clothes, including for post-natal exercise, with a focus on c-sections.
Users can purchase clothes as a guest, with no requirement to register an account. Registered users are offered financial incentives to sign up, such as 10% off their first order â€“ this is due to the importance of data to the company for market research and communication.

In addition the site will offer fitness and nutrition tips and plans, as well as a blog (and if possible forum) for more detailed, real stories on how women maintain fitness during and after pregnancy.

# User Experience Design

## Strategy

Designed to offer nice, affordable workout clothes (exc. trainers) for pregnant women, as well as a range of supportive clothes and accessories for exercise post-pregnancy. There will be a focus on c-section exercise and support.

### Target audience

Women already pregnant or trying to fall pregnant, who either have no, or a low-medium level of fitness pre-pregnancy.

The target audience is looking to purchase low cost work out clothes and accessories. They are also looking for a single source of information on how to get started in fitness during pregnancy. Information they can trust.

It is important that their orders can be created, read/reviewed, edited, and deleted, whether they order as a guest or via an account, following the CRUD basic operations of persistent storage.

## Scope
